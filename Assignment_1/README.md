The solution has been implemented in python using the hashlib and timeit libraries.  A while loop runs from i = 0 to the required value which when appended to the given string satisfies the condition.
Once the required value is reached, the loop is broken. 
The first printed value is required to append to our string to satisfy the condition and the second value is the execution time.
