# It is a De-centralized loaning system
This is because, there is no involvement of third parties like banks or corporations who are holding the people's money. Money transaction is done completely with the use of technology. Security protocols are used to create financial networks and connections which undergo financial transaction. Thus the bridge between lender and borrower is eliminated.

# Disadvantages of Centralized system
1) Each entity in the chain receives payment for its services. 
2) There is an unnecessaey delay at each point of the chain. Loan aproovals may take days or weeks sometimes.
3) There are a lot of formalities which has to be done for each entity in the chain of third parties.
4) It is based on the trust between the user and the third parties, which has complete control of the user's money.
